                <h2>Miscellaneous...</h2>
                <p>
                Well i can't just not have a miscellaneous section, then i'd have to categorise
                everything that i put on the site despite most of it being random, short-lived, and 
                varied. I can't really have 50 different categories or the main menu thing would
                get big. I guess i could have sub-categories but that sounds like a lot of work.
                I like programming.. not fucking around with markup all the time.
