        <h2>Simple css3 animations</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>With the advent of css3 comes css based animations. This is pretty
        cool. It lets you do lots of that annoying shit designers love from
        the safety of the command line. That shit is lit fam.</p>

        <p>In very simple terms a css animation is typically just a transition. Open to
        closed, red to blue. However its a smooth transition that shows all the
        nice inbetween stuff.<p>

        <p> To begin you create a @keyframes x block of css and then tie it to an element.
        You give the keyframes block a from and a to property then stick a few intuitive properties
        on the element itself.</p>

<pre><code class="CSS">
 /* the @keyframes block */
@keyframes x {
    from {
        background-color: white;
    }
    to {
        background-color: black;
    }
}

/* the element to be animated */
.dopeElement {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: white;
    animation-name: x;
    animation-duration: 5s;
    animation-times: 5s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
} 
</code></pre>

        <p> This should look something like this: </p>
        <div class="dopeElement"></div>
        <p> Not very exciting on the face of it but atleast we have something
        another common requirement is to animate a change in size. Like expanding
        a menu or similar. To do this we simply change the from and to properties,
        however we can have more than one set so we will change the color and the
        size in this next animation. using:<p>

<pre><code class="CSS">
/* the @keyframes block */
@keyframes xx {
    from {
        background-color: white;
        width: 100px;
    }
    to {
        background-color: black;
        width: 500px;
    }
}

/* the element to be animated */
.evenDoperElement {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: white;
    animation-name: xx;
    animation-duration: 5s;
    animation-times: 5s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-direction: alternate;
} 
</code></pre>
        <p> Which should look something like this: </p>
        <div class="evenDoperElement"><p>with text!</p></div>
        <p> In this example we also used the alternate
        animation-direction to make it go forwards the backwards
        smoothly rather than forwards then cut back to the start.
        It's easy to think of the various ways you can animate
        something.</p>
        <div class="square-anim"><p>weeee</p></div>
        <p>Of course just because you can really really
        doesnt mean you should.<p>
        <button class="fuck">submit</button>
        <p>Anyway, for the sake of completeness, heres a list of some animation properties 
        ripped from w3schools whose tut is better than this anyway:
        <table class="w3-table-all notranslate">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th style="width:28%">Property</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>@keyframes</td>
    <td>Specifies the animation code</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>animation</td>
    <td>A shorthand property for setting all the animation properties</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>animation-delay</td>
    <td>Specifies a delay for the start of an animation</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>animation-direction</td>
    <td>Specifies whether an animation should play in reverse direction or alternate cycles</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>animation-duration</td>
   <td>Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds an animation takes to complete one cycle</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>animation-fill-mode</td>
   <td>Specifies a style for the element when the animation is not playing (when it is finished, or when it has a delay)</td>
   </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>animation-iteration-count</td>
   <td>Specifies the number of times an animation should be played</td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>animation-name</td>
    <td>Specifies the name of the @keyframes animation</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>animation-play-state</td>
    <td>Specifies whether the animation is running or paused</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>animation-timing-function</td>
    <td>Specifies the speed curve of the animation</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
