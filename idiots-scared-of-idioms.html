    <h2>Idiots Scared of Idioms</h2>
    <h5>Working title: driving off a cliff to avoid a pothole</h5>
    <hr>
    <p>I wonder if morons in other industries do this..</p>
    <p>What i'm talking about is when people get the idea that a certain <i>thing</i>
    is "bad" so they decide to avoid it for the rest of the enternity, no matter what.
    An example of this i encountered recently was !important. An oft misused piece of
    css that does still have its place in the spec. Now i understand that you want to
    avoid abusing important, but it has it's place. A more extreme example, also a real
    world example is magic numbers. Now, i realise that they are generally bad but i 
    think that setting up global variables like <i>"one = 1"</i> and <i>"zero = 0"</i>
    is the work of a crazy person.</p>

    <p>Of course the natural response to this is that these are bad examples. The person
    who is replacing all numbers with globals just doesn't know any better, atleast they're
    trying right? No. No, they're not. They heard that magic numbers are bad, but they don't
    understand why, or what a magic number even is. So rather than TRY to understand they
    just blindly commit atrocities in the name of coding standards.</p>

    <p>Also, terrifyingly: this pattern is encouraged. Tech talks about ripping out importants
    and replacing them with 20 classes to out specify the underlying style are commended. 
    "tech leads" are reccommending the approach. It's like painting your car with nail polish
    because you heard that X brand of paint is bad. <i>"Well this maybelline nail polish
    isn't x brand paint, so if i use this i can stop doing something bad!"</i>.
