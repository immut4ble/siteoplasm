                <h1>Ruby Syntax</h1>
                <h2>a reminder of the basic ruby syntax</h2>
                <p>
                Basically just a few examples of simple ruby syntax; assignment, 
                functions, control flow etc. I find writing, and re-reading these
                helps to put me in the mindset of a language even when it's really
                simple like this. For some reason it just works a lot better when
                it's mine even though the quality is worse than a lot of the cheatsheets
                and things available online.
                </p>
<pre><code class="ruby">
# My ruby basic syntax file.
# the # character is the comment character in ruby.


# Assignment and basic types
# #################################################
# This is assignement, much like other langs:
x = 1

# Strings are also typical:
x = "Foo";

# string literals:
'string literal'
# Escaped
'Don\'t?'

# Expression substitution:
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3 
puts "x is #{ x }."
puts "x plus y is #{ x + y }."
puts "x plus y plus z over 3 is #{ (x + y + z)/3 }."

# Basic IO
# the following is a decent reference for i/o
# https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_input_output.htm
puts "Enter a value :"
val = gets
puts val

# Control Flow
# #################################################
# it's intuitive, quite pretty.
if x &gt; 2
        # then do this.
elsif x &lt;= 2 and x!=0
        # otherwise this?
else
        # or this.
end

# oh yeah, you print like so:
puts "hello world"

# control flow gets pretty sweet in ruby tho:
puts "hey" if true

# oh and there is the opposite of if: unless!
unless x &gt; 2
    puts "this"
else
    puts "that"
end

# and you can do it like this aswell.
puts "hey" unless false


# Loopin'
# #################################################
# nice and simple.
while true do
    puts "aaaaah"
end

# Getting fun.
puts "this" while true

# even funner:
begin
   puts "foo"
   puts "bar"
end while true

# and just like with if, we get the inverse! until:
until false do
    puts "aaaaah"
end

# for loops.
for i in 0..5 #0..5 is an expression for 0 to 5 which is dope
    puts "Value of local variable is #{i}" # the #{x} syntax is also dope.
end

# you've also got break to escape.
while true do
    # will get eval'd
    break
    # won't get eval'd
end

# next will skip to the next iterator which is fun.
for i in 0..5
   if i &lt; 2 then
      next
   end
   puts "Value of local variable is #{i}"
   # 2,3,4,5 will get put'ted. 1 will get skipped.
end


# Functions
# #################################################

# Just like python ruby uses def.
def foo(a, b)
    a + b
end

# Oh and the last statement is the return statement. Like LISP! 
def foo()
    a = 0
    b = 1
    c = 3
end # Returns 3

# Default params, no built in currying.
def foo(a = 21, b = 12)
    a + b
end

# if you want more complicated returns then return is still around.
def foo()
    return 1,2,3,4,5
end

# Variable length inputs, a nice touch.
def foo(*test)
    for i in 0...test.length
        puts "#{test[i]}"
    end
end


# Blocks
# #################################################

# yeild? wtf is yeild.
# ..So blocks in ruby are chunks enclosed in {} which are
# invoked from a similarly named method. ie:

# method
def test()
    puts "method"
    yeild
    puts "back to method"
end
test { puts "now in the block" }

# and it can take params.
def test()
    puts "method"
    yeild 1
    puts "back to method"
    yeild 2
end
test {|i| puts "now in the block #{i}" }
