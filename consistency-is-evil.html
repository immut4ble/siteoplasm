    <h2>Consistency is evil</h2>
    <h5>The we've always done it this way complex.</h5>
    <hr>
    <p>It's such a strange mindset to me. This is how its been 
    done so this is how we should keep doing it. A halfwit 
    child can see the flaws in this logic, and yet, It's a 
    common and popular opinion. Lets say theres a file like:
<pre><code class="javascript">
// Some globals
var thisthing = 1;
var thatthing = 2;

// 500 more lines

// The only use of those globals
var dopefunc() {
    return thisthing + thatthing;
}

// More crap
</code></pre>
    <p>Now the moment a developer opens this file he makes
    a descision, to either:<br>A) Add more globals, to be consistent.
    <br>or<br>B) Be a decent human being.<br>Yes, there are times
    when consistency is important, I'm not arguing that. But 
    if the only reason you have for an action is consistency
    then you are probably making the wrong choice. It's such an obvious
    falsehood.<br><i>"We've always done it this way"</i> is 
    the same sort of reasoning as <i>"Its good because its good"
    </i>. AKA No reasoning at all.</p>

    <p>What's even worse is that people use this reasoning to
    protect their insecurities. <i>"Yes X is <u>technically</u> best
    practice, but in this file the pattern has been to do Z so we should
    stick with that"</i> The annoying thing about arguments like
    this is the fact that more often than not the person is
    against X because they don't understand it, not because they
    truly think that consistently using a bad practice is a good idea.</p>
