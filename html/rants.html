                If this page looks this way its probably because you don't have access to the real content. 
                Sorry about that. Don't try looking in the html, it's not display none'd or something, I'm
                not (that much of) a moron. Anyway, i restrict access to the rants since they discuss real
                people and real software in a fairly critical tone that i'd rather wasn't shared with <i>
                absolutely</i> everyone. Thanks for coming though, heres an example of a Do loop construct
                in FORTRAN77. Jesus, it looks better to me than modern C# / Java.
