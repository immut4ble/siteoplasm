                        <h2>Why there are so many shit programmers in the industry</h2>
                        <p> Quora Answer excerpt that i wanted to keep as reference: </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Second, plenty of people can "talk tech" without knowing what
                        they're actually talking about. The "Agile" movement is full of
                        that shit; people who couldn't hack it as programmers throwing
                        around dated, failed project-management lingo that the rest of
                        the world has discarded, mixed in with some random athletic
                        terminology (sprints and scrums and spikes) that has nothing to
                        do with anything, and managing to convince even tech bosses that
                        they have the magic skillz necessary to "run" programmers.</p>

                        <p> It's not limited to "Agile", though. There are just a large number 
                        of people who, being intelligent and articulate in a general sense,
                        are great at making it sound like they know what they're talking
                        about. I know that they exist because I can be one. I'm actually
                        a good programmer overall, but there are plenty of subjects that
                        I don't know shit about, although I could easily, with 45 minutes
                        of study, convince any Harvard MBA on the planet that I was a
                        world-class expert. It's a skill that some people learn, and it
                        opens doors, and in programming it often means that people get in
                        who don't belong. Google, to its credit, is at least smart enough
                        to put those people into product management and HR roles. That's 
                        how it keeps the quality of its engineering organization so high.</p>

                        <p>Third, it's hard to find good programmers because this industry is
                        badly run, and tends to expel from the top due to this fact. Tech
                        is so profitable when it works that the upside enables a very low
                        quality of management. However, that starts to bother the best
                        programmers, who dislike the career volatility that comes from being
                        in an industry where so many incapable people have so much power.
                        After 10 years, every programmer worth her salt is sick of justifying
                        days and weeks of her own working time in terms of "user stories" and
                        "backlog scrum points". It's immature, it's humiliating, it's wasteful,
                        and it pushes out talent. Many of the best people leave programming,
                        for management or law or medical school. Others become expensive
                        consultants at $1,000 to $5,000 per day. Some others become founders,
                        and yet others just underperform (due to the low expectations of
                        corporate programming) and use their cushy jobs to study the CS topics
                        they actually care about while working an hour a day. </p>

                        </p>The end result of
                        this, though, is that the good people get pushed out of the industry.
                        Add on the back-door age discrimination (ageism being especially cruel
                        in a skill-intensive field where you're "old" by the time you're any
                        good at it) of "Scrum" and open-plan offices and this problem is
                        exacerbated. There just aren't many good people who want to do mainstream
                        business software engineering. </p>
